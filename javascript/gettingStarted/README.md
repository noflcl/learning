# Codecademy
## Javascript

The `gettingStarted` repository it my introduction to JS. I am working through the Codecademy JS course and as I make my way through I am in parallel building out this little play with me project. I'm taking concepts learned in the course then expanding on them so there is user interaction with a webpage, code reuse, and some basic UI elements rather than just console output. 

Some of the first things you accomplish in the course is building some very basic games that play out in your console as text only. I will take those games and extend their features to keep a basic score, add a little bit of artwork, and create a very basic UI for user to play the games. 

### Project Goals:
  - [ ] Write 3 games to play
    - [x] Roshambo
    - [ ] tbd
    - [ ] tbd
  - [ ] Create a score board
  - [ ] Create game UI elements
  - [x] Create a reusable "games window"
  - [x] Load each game within that reusable window
