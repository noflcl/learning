# Learning Web Development

Within this repository I will slowly build out the skills to become a competent full stack developer. The initial goal is to focus on `Javascript` since I know little to nothing about it, and extend my shakey at best skills in `HTML` and `CSS` at the same time. My realy goal here is JS competency though.
