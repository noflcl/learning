> I am writing a bash script which I will use frequently and which takes a text file as one of its inputs.

How I interpret this:

`my-bash-script.sh shortName` - You want shortName to be an alias to a file location & be able to have multiple shortName2, shortName3...

Since you are already using a bash script why not scrap the alias and bring your file locations into your script allowing the ability to reuse and port the script to other operating systems with minimal changes.
